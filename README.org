#+TITLE: Gigabyte Monitor control

* Introduction

A CLI tool to change monitor settings over USB to the Gigabyte M32U

* Supported monitors
- Gigabyte M32U

In theory any Gigabyte Monitor that uses a Realtek HID device (presumably the
M28U also uses this) to control it over OSD sidekick *should* have the same
protocol, but this is the only one I own.

* To install:

You'll need libhidapi and libudev -- on Debians that's ~apt install
libhidapi-dev libudev-dev~, and on darwin you can use ~brew install hidapi~

#+begin_src sh
go install github.com/kelvie/gbmonctl@latest
#+end_src

** Mac specific steps:
On Mac, you might run into an error like this when running the above command:

#+begin_src sh
# github.com/sstallion/go-hid
/Users/dport/go/pkg/mod/github.com/sstallion/go-hid@v0.0.0-20190621001400-1cf4630be9f4/hid.go:38:10: fatal error: 'hidapi/hidapi.h' file not found
#include <hidapi/hidapi.h>
         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
#+end_src

This means ~go~ cannot find the headers / library for ~hidapi~. To fix this, tell ~go~ where to find them. First, figure out where ~hidapi~ is:
#+begin_src sh
$ brew info hidapi | grep files
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/hidapi/0.12.0 (19 files, 185KB) *
#+end_src

Now try to install ~gbmonctl~ like this:

#+begin_src sh
CGO_CFLAGS='-I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/hidapi/0.12.0/include' CGO_LDFLAGS='-L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/hidapi/0.12.0/lib' go install github.com/kelvie/gbmonctl@latest
#+end_src

* To use:

#+begin_example
~ ~/go/bin/gbmonctl
ERROR: -prop or -propNum is required

Usage of gbmonctl:
  -n    Dry run: test commands and print instead
  -prop string
        Property to set. Available properties:
                brightness (0-100)
                contrast (0-100)
                sharpness (0-10)
                low-blue-light (0-10)
                        Blue light reduction. 0 means no reduction.
                kvm-switch (0-1)
                        Switch KVM to device 0 or 1
                colour-mode (0-3)
                        0 is cool, 1 is normal, 2 is warm, 3 is user-defined.
                rgb-red (0-255)
                        Red value -- only works if colour-mode is set to 3
                rgb-green (0-255)
                        Green value -- only works if colour-mode is set to 3
                rgb-blue (0-255)
                        Blue value -- only works if colour-mode is set to 3
  -propNum uint
        Property number to set instead of -prop
  -val int
        Value to set property to (default -1)
#+end_example

Examples:
#+begin_src sh
# Set brightness to 50
gbmonctl -prop brightness -val 50

# Set contrast to 50
gbmonctl -prop contrast -v 50

# Set sharpness to 5
gbmonctl -prop sharpness -v 5

# Set colour temperature to 2700K for nighttime
gbmonctl -prop colour-mode -val 3
gbmonctl -prop rgb-red -val 100
gbmonctl -prop rgb-green -val 66
gbmonctl -prop rgb-blue -val 35
#+end_src

When using propNum, I don't recommend using values that are out of the ranges
listed, and this program doesn't check, so I'm not liable for monitor damage
that occurs from this.

* Other notes
~fwupd~ seems to delete the hidraw device that this uses, so you will have to
disable fwupd and re-plug in your monitor (hit the KVM switch on the side), see
https://github.com/kelvie/gbmonctl/issues/1

* TO-DO
- Get the rest of the commands
- Make more user friendly
